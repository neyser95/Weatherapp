# Weatherapp
As a final project for class we had remake the weather app from last semester but instead of using php we had to use Node.js. We have beening learning how to use Node.js with express and other 
npm packages. If anyone decides to use ths code and change it then just know you need to add then api key from 
OpenWeatherMap.
